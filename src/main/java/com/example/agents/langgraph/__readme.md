  LangGraph4j Agent Architecture: GM Vehicle Advisor System

  Core Justification

  The key insight is that car buying is not a linear process
   - customers often jump between concerns (budget,
  features, family needs), revisit decisions, and need
  different types of expertise. A graph structure naturally
  models this non-linear, multi-expert consultation process.

  Graph Structure

  1. Specialized Expert Nodes

  - Customer Profiler Agent: Understands customer needs,
  family size, lifestyle, usage patterns
  - Financial Advisor Agent: Handles budget analysis,
  financing options, total cost of ownership
  - Technical Expert Agent: Deep knowledge of specs,
  performance, comparisons
  - Availability Coordinator Agent: Dealer inventory,
  scheduling test drives, delivery times
  - Negotiation Coach Agent: Helps with pricing strategies,
  trade-in values, best times to buy

 I2  2. Routing/Orchestrator Node

  - Intent Classifier: Analyzes user input and routes to
  appropriate expert
  - Maintains conversation context across all agents
  - Decides when to hand off between experts

  3. State Management

  CustomerProfile {
    - budget constraints
    - must-have features
    - family requirements
    - usage patterns (commute, road trips, etc.)
    - preferences discovered during conversation
  }

  Key Graph Flows

  Multi-Expert Consultation Flow

  1. User asks about "family SUV under $40k"
  2. Profiler Agent gathers family size, safety priorities
  3. Financial Advisor calculates affordable price range
  with financing
  4. Technical Expert filters vehicles matching criteria
  5. If user mentions "towing", loops back to Profiler to
  understand towing needs
  6. Technical Expert revises recommendations based on
  towing capacity

  Conditional Branching

  - If budget < $30k → Route to used/certified pre-owned
  specialist node
  - If electric vehicle interest → Route to EV specialist
  node with charging analysis
  - If commercial use → Route to fleet/business specialist
  node

  Feedback Loops

  - User rejects recommendations → Loop back to Profiler to
  refine understanding
  - Price too high → Financial Advisor suggests alternatives
   (longer terms, lower trim)
  - Feature missing → Technical Expert suggests similar
  vehicles or aftermarket options

  Compelling Scenarios That Justify LangGraph

  1. Complex Decision Trees: "I need something for my family
   but also for my construction business" - requires
  multiple expert consultations and conditional paths
  2. Iterative Refinement: Customer starts wanting a truck,
  realizes they need better fuel economy, considers SUV,
  worries about towing capacity - the graph allows natural
  back-and-forth between experts
  3. Parallel Processing: While Technical Expert searches
  vehicles, Financial Advisor can simultaneously calculate
  financing options
  4. Context-Aware Handoffs: Each agent can see what others
  have learned, avoiding repetitive questions
  5. Dynamic Expertise: Based on customer profile
  (first-time buyer vs. fleet manager), different expert
  paths activate

  Why This Beats Simple Linear Agents

  1. Natural Conversation Flow: Mimics how real car shopping
   works - you don't linearly go through every aspect
  2. Expertise Separation: Each agent can have specialized
  prompts and knowledge
  3. Reusability: Expert nodes can be reused in different
  flows
  4. Scalability: Easy to add new expert nodes (e.g.,
  Insurance Advisor, Maintenance Planner)
  5. State Persistence: Customer profile builds throughout
  the conversation across all agents

  This architecture provides clear value over a simple
  single agent with tools, as it models the complex,
  non-linear nature of vehicle selection with multiple
  specialized perspectives working together.
