## Current Agent Responsibilities

### IntentClassifierAgent
- **Primary Role**: Routes user queries to appropriate specialist agents
- **Key Features**: Priority-based routing, conversation analysis, context awareness

### CustomerProfilerAgent
- **Primary Role**: Understands customer needs and builds profiles
- **Tools**: Need analysis, profile building, category suggestions, vehicle filtering
- **Strength**: Minimal questioning approach, extracts context from conversation

### TechnicalExpertAgent
- **Primary Role**: Provides detailed vehicle information and comparisons
- **Tools**: Most comprehensive toolset including search, compare, TCO, safety
- **Issue**: Overloaded with both search and analysis responsibilities

### FinancialAdvisorAgent
- **Primary Role**: Handles financing, insurance, and budgeting
- **Tools**: Loan calculations, insurance estimates, budget recommendations

### AvailabilityCoordinatorAgent
- **Primary Role**: Manages inventory and test drive scheduling
- **Tools**: Real-time inventory checks, appointment booking

### EVSpecialistAgent
- **Primary Role**: Electric vehicle expertise and EV-specific concerns
- **Tools**: Charging costs, station finder, range calculations

### NegotiationCoachAgent
- **Primary Role**: Pricing strategy and deal optimization
- **Tools**: Trade-in values, negotiation tactics, incentive tracking

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Agent Responsibility Redistribution

**Create VehicleSearchAgent (New)**
- Consolidate all vehicle search functionality from TechnicalExpertAgent
- Merge CustomerProfilerAgent's filtering capabilities
- Single source for vehicle discovery

**Enhanced TechnicalExpertAgent**
- Focus on specifications, comparisons, and technical Q&A
- Remove search functionality
- Add maintenance info and feature explanations

**Merge Financial Agents**
- Combine FinancialAdvisorAgent and NegotiationCoachAgent
- Create unified FinancialStrategyAgent
- Include TCO calculations (move from TechnicalExpert)

**Expand CustomerProfilerAgent**
- Own complete customer journey mapping
- Add lifecycle tracking (research -> comparison -> decision -> purchase)
- Maintain preference history across sessions

### 2. Key User Interaction Scenarios

**Scenario 1: First-Time Buyer Journey**
- Current: Multiple handoffs lose context
- Solution: CustomerProfiler orchestrates entire discovery phase

**Scenario 2: Comparison Shopping**
- Current: Missing EV insights and cost comparisons
- Solution: Multi-agent collaboration (Technical + EV + Financial)

**Scenario 3: Ready to Buy**
- Current: Missing pre-purchase preparation
- Solution: AvailabilityCoordinator triggers preparation workflow

**Scenario 4: Budget-Conscious Shopping**
- Current: Ambiguous routing between agents
- Solution: New VehicleSearchAgent with multi-criteria filtering

### 3. Architectural Improvements

**1. Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol**
- Enable task force approach for complex queries
- Example: Vehicle comparison triggers multiple specialist agents

**2. Context Enrichment Layer**
- Shared context service maintains structured customer data
- Reduces redundant LLM calls
- Ensures consistent understanding across agents

**3. Workflow Templates**
- Define common journey patterns
- Specify agent sequences and data flow
- Improve user experience through predictable flows

**4. Enhanced State Management**
- Journey Stage (research/comparison/decision/purchase)
- Interaction History with each agent
- Extracted Preferences (persistent)
- Active Recommendations
- Pending Actions

**5. Tool Optimization**
- Eliminate redundant search capabilities
- Create shared utility tools
- Standardize response formats

**6. Proactive Behavior**
- Agents suggest next steps based on journey stage
- Example: After vehicle selection, proactively offer financing

**7. Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation when agents fail
- Retry logic with alternative agents
- Better ambiguous request handling

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Consolidate search functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Merge financial agents
3. **Phase 3**: Add collaboration protocol
4. **Phase 4**: Enhance state management

## Key Insights

The current architecture demonstrates solid separation of concerns with specialized agents handling distinct domains. However, opportunities exist to:
- Reduce functional overlap
- Enable better multi-agent collaboration
- Create more cohesive end-to-end user experiences
- Optimize tool distribution
- Enhance context sharing

The system handles individual queries well but could better support complete customer journeys through workflow templates and richer state management.
